## Notes

- Not much of a set: only one theme is present at the moment: the dark version is at a rather early stage of development, while the light version is not ready for its debut yet.

- The colours in Le Corbusier's original palette were not designed to be used in this way, but it is only an experiment. The colours turn out a bit darkish and gloomy, esp. in modes with few builtins (e.g., Haskell).

- Tweaked for a few programming languages, but looks ugly on HTML (and the HTML mode seems to rely directly on the standard Font Lock faces, so I don't see how one can tweak a theme for HTML)
